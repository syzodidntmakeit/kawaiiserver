### Breaking free from Big Tech, one container at a time üê±

Welcome to my personal server setup! This is where I've channeled my cybersecurity curiosity and networking passion into building a completely self-hosted digital life. No more giving Google my data, no more subscription fees for basic features, and definitely no more wondering what happens to my Rei Ayanami fanfiction.

---

## üéØ Philosophy

- **Privacy First**: Your data belongs to YOU, not corporations
- **Open Source**: If you can't audit it, don't trust it
- **Self-Reliance**: Why pay monthly fees when you can learn and own it?
- **Learning by Doing**: Break things, fix them, become unstoppable

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure

### Main Server Hardware Recommendations

| Component | Minimum Spec | Recommended | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| **CPU** | Intel i5-8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600 | Intel i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 7 3700X | Media transcoding & AI workloads |
| **RAM** | 16GB DDR4 | 32GB DDR4 | Containers are hungry |
| **Storage** | 256GB SSD | 512GB NVMe | OS and containers only |
| **Form Factor** | SFF (Small Form Factor) | Tower | Upgradability matters |
| **GPU** *(Optional)* | - | RTX 3060 / RX 6800 | Local AI models |

### NAS Hardware (Orange Pi 5 Recommended)

| Option | Cost (SGD) | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------------|------|------|
| **Orange Pi 5 Kit** | ~$290 | RK3588S CPU, PCIe NVMe, USB 3.0, complete kit | Less community support than Pi |
| **Raspberry Pi 4** | ~$120 | Massive community, proven reliability | Limited to USB 3.0 speeds |
| **Used Mini PC** | ~$160 | Full x86, SATA ports, overkill performance | Higher power consumption |

*The Orange Pi 5 hits the sweet spot - powerful enough for advanced NAS features, efficient enough for 24/7 operation*

*Why separate? Keep your media safe when you inevitably break the main server while tinkering.*

### Storage Strategy
- **Main Server**: 512GB NVMe for OS, containers, and configs
- **NAS Box**: 32GB eMMC for OS + 4TB WD Red for media storage  
- **Bonus Storage**: 1TB HDD from main server (backup/overflow)
- **Connection**: SMB/NFS shares mounted from Orange Pi 5 to main server

### Suggested Hardware (Singapore Pricing - Tested Configs)

### Suggested Hardware (Singapore Pricing - ACTUAL Tested Deals!)

**üéØ Recommended Setup (Total: ~$668 SGD) - *Confirmed Available***

*This setup gives you enterprise-grade homelab performance for less than most people spend on a gaming GPU!*

*Pro tip: Old office PCs are perfect for this. Let some corporation's depreciation be your gain.*

### Core Technologies

- **OS**: Debian 12 *(Stability over street cred - trust me on this one)*
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Reverse Proxy**: Traefik (auto-SSL) or Nginx
- **Domain**: Cloudflare-managed domain
- **VPN**: Mullvad (for the *arr stack)
- **Security**: UFW + Fail2Ban

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Get Hardware**: Snag an old office PC or use what you have
2. **Install Arch**: Because we're not casuals here
2. **Setup Docker**: The foundation of everything
3. **Configure Cloudflare**: Buy a domain, set up DNS  
4. **Setup NAS**: Orange Pi 5 with OpenMediaVault
5. **Configure Network**: D-Link managed switch for proper VLANs
6. **Deploy Services**: Start with Jellyfin + arr stack, expand gradually
7. **Secure Everything**: UFW, Fail2Ban, proper authentication

*Detailed setup guides coming soon‚Ñ¢*

## üåü Why Self-Host?

- **Privacy**: Your data never leaves your hardware
- **Control**: No sudden feature removals or price hikes
- **Learning**: Become a networking wizard
- **Bragging Rights**: "I host my own Netflix" hits different
- **Cost Effective**: One-time hardware cost vs endless subscriptions
- **Reliability**: No "service temporarily unavailable" messages

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Fair Warning

This isn't for everyone. You'll need:
- Patience for troubleshooting
- Willingness to learn Linux
- Comfort with breaking (and fixing) things
- Basic networking knowledge
- Time for maintenance

If you want plug-and-play, stick with the cloud services. If you want to own your digital life, welcome aboard! üö¢

**Remember**: *"I use Debian btw"* doesn't have the same ring to it, but your uptime will thank you. üòé

### üéØ Pro Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Don't deploy everything at once, you'll hate troubleshooting
2. **Document Everything**: Future you will curse present you for not taking notes
3. **Backup Strategy**: 3-2-1 rule - 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite
4. **Security First**: Change default passwords, use 2FA, keep things updated
5. **Monitor Resources**: Know when you're hitting limits before things crash
6. **Test Restores**: Backups are useless if you can't restore them
7. **Network Isolation**: VLANs aren't just for enterprises anymore

*P.S. - Yes, this setup runs my Rei Ayanami fanfiction archive. No, you can't have access. Some things are sacred. And yes, I switched to Debian AND found amazing Singapore deals on Shopee/Carousell. Character growth is real.*

### üõí **Singapore Shopping Pro Tips**
- **Carousell**: Best deals on used business PCs AND networking gear (that $30 switch though! üî•)
- **Shopee**: Great for SBC kits like Orange Pi, watch for flash sales
- **Sim Lim Square**: Components and cables, but Carousell might be cheaper
- **Lazada**: Backup option if Shopee stock runs out
- **Local Facebook Groups**: Sometimes hidden gems in tech swap groups
- **Pro Tip**: Check Carousell notifications daily - good deals disappear fast!
