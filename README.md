### Breaking free from Big Tech, one container at a time üê±

Welcome to my personal server setup! This is where I've channeled my cybersecurity curiosity and networking passion into building a completely self-hosted digital life. No more giving Google my data, no more subscription fees for basic features, and definitely no more wondering what happens to my Rei Ayanami fanfiction.

## üéØ Philosophy

- **Privacy First**: Your data belongs to YOU, not corporations
- **Open Source**: If you can't audit it, don't trust it
- **Self-Reliance**: Why pay monthly fees when you can learn and own it?
- **Learning by Doing**: Break things, fix them, become unstoppable

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure

### Hardware Recommendations

| Component | Minimum Spec | Recommended | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----|

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Get Hardware**: Snag an old office PC or use what you have
2. **Install Arch**: Because we're not casuals here
3. **Setup Docker**: The foundation of everything
4. **Configure Cloudflare**: Buy a domain, set up DNS
5. **Deploy Services**: Start with essentials, expand gradually
6. **Secure Everything**: UFW, Fail2Ban, proper authentication

*Detailed setup guides coming soon‚Ñ¢*

## üåü Why Self-Host?

- **Privacy**: Your data never leaves your hardware
- **Control**: No sudden feature removals or price hikes
- **Learning**: Become a networking wizard
- **Bragging Rights**: "I host my own Netflix" hits different
- **Cost Effective**: One-time hardware cost vs endless subscriptions
- **Reliability**: No "service temporarily unavailable" messages

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Fair Warning

This isn't for everyone. You'll need:
- Patience for troubleshooting
- Willingness to learn Linux
- Comfort with breaking (and fixing) things
- Basic networking knowledge
- Time for maintenance

If you want plug-and-play, stick with the cloud services. If you want to own your digital life, welcome aboard! üö¢
